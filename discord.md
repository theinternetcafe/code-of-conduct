## DISCORD ROLES
All @Verified users have great amounts of permission to change 
the server unilaterally. For more dangerous permissions, 
direct democracy is utilized.

@Super are capable of utilizing all permissions. The other
roles are similar but have some limitations.

@Power cannot ban other @Power  or @Super ,
nor add integrations to the server like bots.

@Verified Users cannot change permissions of the `Vox` or 
`Scrib` categories, manage the `Ministro` category, move 
users in the `Vox`category,view the #dyno channel, nor ban 
other @Verified , @Power  or @Super users.

Democracy is instituted through votes which exceed 50%
approval of all @Verified  users. Votes are held in the #democracy 
channel. Some examples of topics for voting might be banning a 
@Verified, @Power or @Super changing the order of
categories, adding a bot to the server, or managing channels in the
`Ministro` category.

Unclaimed Categories can be claimed by @Verified by modifying the 
permissions and are replenished by request if there are none available.

For full access (many voice and text channels), contact a Power User 
or Super User (e.g. @ztk.) to be given the Verified role. This is a fairly 
tight knit community and we have an additional level of screening to
protect existing users.
